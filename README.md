# Cultural-Bias-LLMs
Cross-Cultural Emotion Expression in Large Language Models
I. Theoretical Introduction
Background
Recent decades have shown increasing interest in cross-cultural differences in emotional expression, driven by globalization and advances in communication technology. The intersection of cultural differences and artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), presents unique research opportunities and challenges.
Historical Context
The development of language models has evolved from early neural networks and natural language processing to breakthrough architectures like Transformer and BERT, leading to the revolutionary GPT models.
Theoretical Framework
The research integrates multiple theoretical perspectives:

Historical evolution of emotion understanding
Emotions as multidimensional constructs
Cultural construction of self
Linguistic relativity in emotion expression

II. Research Plan
Research Objectives

Examine Anglo-centrism in emotional expression by LLMs in Polish and English
Evaluate the impact of cultural prompts on emotional content generation
Compare model effectiveness in capturing cultural nuances
Analyze embeddings for individualistic and collectivistic patterns
Expand scenarios to cover diverse cultural contexts

Materials and Methods
Models

GPT-4o (extended GPT-4 version)
GPT-o1 (model with enhanced chain-of-thought reasoning)

Languages

English (EN) - representing individualistic culture
Polish (PL) - moderately individualistic culture with collectivistic elements

Scenarios
15 carefully designed situational scenarios including:

Public praise at work
Public criticism
Family financial requests
Workplace conflicts
Social obligations
Personal relationships

System Prompts

Neutral prompt (no cultural information)
Cultural prompt EN (US-specific context)
Cultural prompt PL (Polish-specific context)
